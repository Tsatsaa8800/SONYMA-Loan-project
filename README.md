# [SONYMA Loan Project] (https://tsatsaa8800.github.io/SONYMA-Loan-project/)

## Project Background
 The State of New York Mortgage Agency (SONYMA) provides financing and programs designed for first-time low- and moderate-income homebuyers in New York State. The purpose of this analysis is to extract valuable insights from the dataset obtained from SONYMA, with the goal of providing recommendations to improve efficiency in loan distribution.

## Data Structure & Initial Checks
SONYMAâ€™s database structure as seen below consists of 1 table, with 14 columns, a total row count of 28500 records. It includes raw data on all the loans purchased by SONYMA from January 2004 until 2016. It includes types of loans (loan amount, loan type, term, LTV, with or without down payment assistance), when the loans were made (purchase date), where the loans are being made (county), and what property types (# of units, construction status, property type).
